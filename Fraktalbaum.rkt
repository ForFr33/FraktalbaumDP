;A posn is either:
;- a polar
;- a cartesian
;interp. a position in 2-dimensional space

;A polar is a structure: (make-polar magnitude angle)
;interp a point in 2-dimensional space depicted as complexx Number

(define-struct cartesian (x y))
;A cartesian is a structure: (make-cartesian-posn Number Number)
;interp. the x and y coordinate of a point int 2-dimensional space

(define-struct vector(polar))
;A vector is a structure: (make-vector polar)
;interp. a line in 2-dimesnional space

;A color is a structure: (make-color(red green blue alpha))
;interp. The representation of red, green, blue and alpha value as color.
