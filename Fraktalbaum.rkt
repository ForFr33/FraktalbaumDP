;A cartesian is a structure: (make-cartesian Number Number)
;interp. the x and y coordinate of a point int 2-dimensional space

;A polar is a structure (make-polar Number Number)

;Anmerkung:
;ich h채tte eigentlich auch gerne ein polar struct definiert, allerdings gibt es in racket/base bereits ein solches und ich war mit nicht sicher,
;ob wir dieses benutzen d체rfen und da der name "polar" bereits daf체r vergeben ist habe ich es so gemacht, dass ein polar einfach als winkel zusammen mit
;der L채nge einer Geraden im zwei-dimensionalen Raum dargestellt wird, ich hoffe, dass das kein Problem ist
